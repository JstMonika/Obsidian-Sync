## Introduction

	1. [[LIPIcs.WABI.2020.15_RawNote#^pfgo8cndh5|can be used as a final step in a divide-and-conquer pipeline]]
2. Same?
	1. provided that optimal supertrees are computed, divide-and-conquer pipelines can be provably statistically consistent under stochastic models of evolution
	2. as the amount of input data (e.g., sequence lengths when estimating gene trees, or number of gene trees when estimating species trees) increases, the probability that the true tree is returned converges to 1
